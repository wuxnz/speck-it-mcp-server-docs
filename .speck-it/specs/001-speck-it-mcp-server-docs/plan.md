# Implementation Plan: Speck-It MCP Server Documentation Site

**Branch**: `001-speck-it-mcp-server-docs` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: .speck-it\specs\001-speck-it-mcp-server-docs\spec.md

## Summary
Speck-It MCP Server Documentation Site empowers users by enabling: a fully featured documentation and release site for the 'ref/speck-it' mcp server; the site should use shadcn ui + typescript + tailwind + next.js + zustand for state management, with a dark theme by default and a theme switcher to light mode; it should be a comprehensive documentation hub inspired by the speck-it mcp server's readme.md, including installation instructions, contribution guidelines, api reference, and guides for users who want to use the code to create new projects; the site should include a link to the github repository and clear instructions for installation, contribution, and getting started with development; the system should automatically update project tasks when the spec is generated.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Primary Dependencies**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Storage**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Target Platform**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Performance Goals**: Define explicit targets
**Constraints**: Capture regulatory, compliance, or legacy constraints
**Scale/Scope**: Document expected load, data volume, or usage cadence

## Constitution Check
- Project: Speck-It MCP Server Documentation
- Purpose:
- Create a comprehensive MCP server documentation site with examples, code snippets, and templates for Speck-It; prioritize TypeScript + shadcn UI, efficient reusable components, strong typing, and Zustand where state is needed.
- Core Principles:
- 1. Language & Stack: Use TypeScript as the primary language for all new code and examples. Prefer modern TypeScript features and strict compiler settings to maximize type-safety and clarity.
- 2. UI: Use shadcn/ui for design system components. Components must be accessible, themeable, and composed from small primitives.
- 3. Reusability & Efficiency: Author small, well-factored, and reusable components and utilities. Favor composition over duplication and adhere to DRY principles.
- 4. Strong Typing: Expose and enforce explicit, well-documented types for public APIs, component props, and library boundaries. Prefer typed interfaces and generics where appropriate.

## Project Structure Recommendation
- `docs/` — specifications (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, research outputs)
- `src/` — primary implementation (models, services, presentation)
- `tests/contract/` — contract tests derived from API contracts
- `tests/integration/` — end-to-end scenarios for Speck-It MCP Server Documentation Site
- `tests/unit/` — focused unit coverage per module

## Research Agenda (Phase 0)
- No open questions. Confirm scope before proceeding.

## Design Deliverables (Phase 1)
- Map requirement 1 to API/data structures. Document contracts covering `a fully featured documentation and release site for the 'ref/speck-it' mcp server`.
- Map requirement 2 to API/data structures. Document contracts covering `the site should use shadcn ui + typescript + tailwind + next.js + zustand for state management, with a dark theme by default and a theme switcher to light mode`.
- Map requirement 3 to API/data structures. Document contracts covering `it should be a comprehensive documentation hub inspired by the speck-it mcp server's readme.md, including installation instructions, contribution guidelines, api reference, and guides for users who want to use the code to create new projects`.
- Map requirement 4 to API/data structures. Document contracts covering `the site should include a link to the github repository and clear instructions for installation, contribution, and getting started with development`.
- Map requirement 5 to API/data structures. Document contracts covering `the system should automatically update project tasks when the spec is generated`.

Deliverables:
- `research.md` — Answers to Phase 0 questions
- `data-model.md` — Entities, relationships, validation rules
- `contracts/` — API schemas or protocol definitions
- `quickstart.md` — Step-by-step validation checklist

## Task Generation Strategy (Phase 2)
- Generate implementation and test tasks for requirement 1.
- Generate implementation and test tasks for requirement 2.
- Generate implementation and test tasks for requirement 3.
- Generate implementation and test tasks for requirement 4.
- Generate implementation and test tasks for requirement 5.

- Order tasks via TDD: tests before implementation
- Mark independent tasks with `[P]` for parallel execution
- Reference exact file paths for every task

## Risks & Mitigations
- Capture dependencies on third-party services or teams
- Flag performance or compliance constraints early
- Document fallback strategies for critical unknowns

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 0 research complete
- [ ] Phase 1 design artifacts ready
- [ ] Phase 2 task list generated
- [ ] Phase 3 implementation underway
- [ ] Phase 4 validation complete

## Next Steps
1. Resolve clarifications and update constitution alignment
2. Complete Phase 0/1 deliverables
3. Invoke task generator once design assets are ready
4. Execute implementation guided by tasks and constitution
