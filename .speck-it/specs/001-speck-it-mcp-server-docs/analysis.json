It should be a comprehensive documentation hub inspired by the speck-it MCP server's README.md, including installation instructions, contribution guidelines, API reference, and guides for users who want to use the code to create new projects. The site should include a link to the GitHub repository and clear instructions for installation, contribution, and getting started with development.
