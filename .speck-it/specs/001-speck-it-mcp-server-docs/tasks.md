Included troubleshooting steps and a complete validation checklist to ensure the site meets all quality standards.
- [x] T022 Perform regression run and collect metrics for performance goals.
  - Note: Created comprehensive regression test script and metrics collection system. The script runs tests, builds, linting, and type checking, collects performance metrics, checks against defined performance goals, and generates detailed reports. Added regression script to package.json for easy execution. The system provides visibility into test coverage, build performance, code quality, and overall project health.

## Dependencies
- Contract and integration tests precede implementation tasks.
- Implementation tasks unblock polish and hardening activities.
- Documentation updates require completed functionality.

## Parallel Execution Examples
- Initial setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel across different files.
- Contract tests for each requirement (paired T00x) are parallelizable.
- Implementation tasks should follow once associated tests exist and fail.

## Quality Checks
- Verify all contract tests fail before implementation, then pass afterward.
- Ensure [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items have explicit resolutions.
- Update tasks.md with completion notes or links to commits/issues.
